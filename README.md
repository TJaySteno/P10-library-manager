## Project 10
### Build a Library Manager

In this project I have been tasked with creating the database manager for a local library. This will track library patrons, books, and any current or past book loans. Using Express alongside Pug, a librarian for my fictitious library can add a new book, show all books, or display books that are either checked out or overdue. They can also display all patrons or create a new one. Finally, they can create a new loan, display every loan past and present, or show all current or overdue loans. For this project I was provided with template HTML and CSS files which I converted into Pug for use with Express.

Unfortunately, I did not have enough time in my life around this time to hit "Exceeds" for this project, but I hope to come back to it someday and add that functionality.

__Grader's Overall Comments:__ "You did it! When you don't have time for exceeds, don't worry about it. There's all the time in the world to get back to exceeds when the time opportunity opens up for you. On your first round with this project, I want to congratulate you on error handling. You made sure to not miss out on any errors. Students usually miss that part when completing this project, getting stumped on how to render database errors in the pug template. Well, you nailed it. This project is also notorious for understanding database associations. The best way to understand them is by doing another project, maybe a self-starter.

"Just two more projects to go!"
